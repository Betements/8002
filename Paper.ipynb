Friedman in their 2019 paper 'Practical Methods To Reduce Privacy Loss When Disclosing Statistics Based On Small Samples'. This particular algorithm was developed in the flavour of differential privacy with the purpose of releasing regression statistics to the public. However, it does not have the privacy guarantee that differential privacy offers. In light of this we repurpose an older algorithm by Dwork and Lei and compare both algorithms under different regression methods, our metric being the mean squared error of the noise infused statistic to the true statistic. Our extension is the firstly the implementation of MM-estimation in the Dwork Lei algorithm, and secondly the application these algorithms to the Multivariate problem. Ultimately we aim to fill in a persistent gap in the differential privacy literature and its pratical application in social science.",
